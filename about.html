						Kate Kiss, PCP, CPB
					</h2>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/frontpic.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Kate has been an active bookkeeper and payroll practitioner since 2000
						achieving certification as a Payroll Compliant Practitioner through
						the CPA, certified Professional Bookkeeper with IPBC, certified
						QuickBooks Pro Advisor and a TSheets certified Pro.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kate's background extends from working with the family furniture
						manufacturing business prior to embarking on her own journey to discover
						her forte.</p>
					<p>
						Kate has a core understanding from many sides of the spectrum derived
						from a diverse choice of professions over the years in roles as
						restaurant manager, assembly line labourer, machine operator,
						shipper/receiver, social committee leader, administrative manager,
						dabbling with IT and remote access veering into natural healing
						attaining certification as a forklift operator, forklift trainer and
						reflexologist.</p>


					<p>Kate's innate leadership abilities and willingness to accept challenging
						projects with positive results has earned her the respect as a hard
						working, dependable and knowledgeable individual. Ultimately the hands
						on experiences of past employments pointed to a common denominator in
						her recognizing the value for organized documentation, transparent
						record keeping along with her interest in the ever evolving career
						associated technologies. This realization brought about the desire to
						pursue a more focused career path that would satiate her passions in her
						fields of expertise while bringing to her client's businesses above and
						beyond service, support and training for effective administrative
						processes delivering competency and compliancy within the GAAP
						(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).</p>

					<p>From hobby to home based business Kate has patiently and methodically
						grown her independent practice establishing roots in a brick and mortar
						location boasting a relaxed, warm and welcoming environment for clients
						and employees.</p>

					<p>
						Kate's personability, professionalism, responsiveness, high level of
						integrity, quality of work and expertise partnered with her commitment
						to continuous learning, translates into a trusting, supportive and
						reliable relationship she builds with her clients.</p>

					<p>Off the clock Kate enjoys visiting the many local conservation park
						areas for a nature walk, shared quality time with close friends and
						partaking in local festivals. In-between tax time and year ends, Kate
						welcomes travelling opportunities to foreign lands exploring new
						cuisines, cultures, music and always looking to integrate with some
						business associated educational tidbit to bring back home.

						Kate is no stranger to carpentry and gardening tools which keeps her
						immersed in home improvement and yard beautification projects with her
						beloved cat by her side.</p>
