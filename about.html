					Kate Kiss, PCP, CPB
				</h2>
				<span class="image"><img class='kate' src="images/frontpic.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p class="katesInfoClass">Kate has been an active bookkeeper and payroll practitioner since 2000
					achieving certification as a Payroll Compliant Practitioner through
					the CPA, certified Professional Bookkeeper with IPBC, certified
					QuickBooks Pro Advisor and a TSheets certified Pro.
				</p>
				<p class="katesInfoClass">
					Kate's background extends from working with the family furniture
					manufacturing business prior to embarking on her own journey to discover
					her forte.</p>
				<p class="katesInfoClass">
					Kate has a core understanding from many sides of the spectrum derived
					from a diverse choice of professions over the years in roles as
					restaurant manager, assembly line labourer, machine operator,
					shipper/receiver, social committee leader, administrative manager,
					dabbling with IT and remote access veering into natural healing
					attaining certification as a forklift operator, forklift trainer and
					reflexologist.</p>


				<p class="katesInfoClass">Kate's innate leadership abilities and willingness to accept challenging
					projects with positive results has earned her the respect as a hard
					working, dependable and knowledgeable individual. Ultimately the hands
					on experiences of past employments pointed to a common denominator in
					her recognizing the value for organized documentation, transparent
					record keeping along with her interest in the ever evolving career
					associated technologies. This realization brought about the desire to
					pursue a more focused career path that would satiate her passions in her
					fields of expertise while bringing to her client's businesses above and
					beyond service, support and training for effective administrative
					processes delivering competency and compliancy within the GAAP
					(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).</p>

				<p class="katesInfoClass">From hobby to home based business Kate has patiently and methodically
					grown her independent practice establishing roots in a brick and mortar
					location boasting a relaxed, warm and welcoming environment for clients
					and employees.</p>

				<p class="katesInfoClass">
					Kate's personability, professionalism, responsiveness, high level of
					integrity, quality of work and expertise partnered with her commitment
					to continuous learning, translates into a trusting, supportive and
					reliable relationship she builds with her clients.</p>

				<p class="katesInfoClass">Off the clock Kate enjoys visiting the many local conservation park
					areas for a nature walk, shared quality time with close friends and
					partaking in local festivals. In-between tax time and year ends, Kate
					welcomes travelling opportunities to foreign lands exploring new
					cuisines, cultures, music and always looking to integrate with some
					business associated educational tidbit to bring back home.

					Kate is no stranger to carpentry and gardening tools which keeps her
					immersed in home improvement and yard beautification projects with her
					beloved cat by her side.</p>
